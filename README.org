* CS2-MPD server
Tiny server that listens to CS2 game updates and pauses MPD while in-game.

So far it plays/pauses music while dead/alive, which is just demo-quality as it
isn't a great experience after all.
Ideally you'd play keep playing music early in the round, and be wary of
teammates left alive.

** Setup
*** CS2 game state integration
Set up CS2 to reach out to our server with some state changes,

Write this into [[~/.local/share/Steam/steamapps/common/Counter-Strike Global Offensive/game/csgo/cfg/gamestate_integration_cs2-mpd.cfg]]

#+begin_src cfg
  "cs2-mpd-rs" {
  	"uri" "http://127.0.0.1:3000"
  	"timeout" "0.5"
  	"buffer"  "0.1"
  	"throttle" "0.5"
  	"heartbeat" "60.0"

  	"data" {
  		"player_id"    "1"  // steamid
  		"player_state" "1"  // armor, flashed, equip_value, health, etc.
  		"round"        "1"  // round phase and the winning team
  	}
  }
#+end_src
